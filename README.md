## Description

This is my first 100% custom built, "farm to table" project. It is serving as both my own personally branded website and online portfolio. I am the sole contributor from design through to the latest live version. Some of my favorite aspects of this site are the mouse tracking animation at the beginning as well as the various interactive elements throughout the page. 

#### Technologies

- Javascript (ES6)
- HTML5
- Sass/CSS3
